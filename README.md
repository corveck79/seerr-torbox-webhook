## 🍄 What is Mycelium?

Mycelium sits between **Seerr**, **TorBox**, and **Jellyfin** and quietly does the boring orchestration so you don't have to:

```
Seerr webhook  →  search Zilean + Torrentio  →  cache-check TorBox
                       ↓
              add the best release         →  Jellyfin-ready .strm file
                       ↓
            (optional) Catbox lazy mode    →  TorBox stays small, library stays huge
```

Built for the **Jellyfin + TorBox + Synology NAS** stack. No FUSE, no rclone, no Plex required (but supported).

---

## 🌱 Why Mycelium?

It started with Real-Debrid quietly filtering "infringing_file" content overnight. No announcement, no migration path. 2,559 of 3,564 cached torrents gone. The Plex library was still there, full of posters and metadata, but every second item threw a "file not available" error when you tried to play it.

The switch to TorBox seemed straightforward. It wasn't.

After migrating the stack, Sonarr triggered a full missing-episode search across thousands of series episodes. Decypharr, configured with 100 workers per debrid, started hammering the FUSE mount with 200 concurrent I/O operations. On spinning HDDs, that's a death sentence. Load hit 165. CPU was at 0.1%. I/O wait was at 97.7%. The NAS needed a hard power cycle to recover.

After throttling workers to 5 and restarting, a new problem surfaced: 123 downloads stuck on `pausedUP`, nothing importing into Sonarr. Three days of debugging `rshared` vs `rslave` mount flags led to the same conclusion: Synology's kernel 4.4 doesn't propagate FUSE mounts reliably into Docker containers. Sonarr could list the directory but couldn't read the files. The import step was broken at the OS level, unfixable by configuration.

TMC was the next attempt. No FUSE, just `.strm` files. It worked until restart, when it wiped the entire library and crashed mid-rebuild on items with missing metadata. No visibility, no repair path.

What started as a simple 100-line webhook to catch a Seerr approval and add a torrent to TorBox quietly grew. At some point it stopped being a webhook and became something else.

The name felt right. Mycelium.

> *Mycelium is the network of fungal threads beneath every forest. It connects the trees and keeps them alive. The mushroom is the only part you see.*

## ✨ Features

<details open>
<summary><b>Core pipeline</b></summary>

- 🪝 **Seerr webhook integration**. Every approved request gets auto-processed.
- 🔎 **Zilean (local) + Torrentio (fallback)** with health-aware skipping.
- ⚡ **TorBox cache-first** strategy with 429 retry and per-hash blacklist.
- 📝 **Jellyfin-friendly naming**: `Movie (Year)/Movie (Year).strm`, `Series/Season XX/Series S01E01.strm`.
- 🎬 **Automatic library refresh**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🪤 Catbox mode (lazy materialization)</b></summary>

Inspired by [elfhosted's CatBox](https://docs.elfhosted.com/app/catbox/). Items live in your library as virtual proxies; the torrent only enters TorBox when you press play, and leaves after `CATBOX_IDLE_MINUTES` of idle time. Stays compliant with TorBox's 30-day cache retention while supporting effectively unlimited library size.

<details>
<summary><b>🎯 Smart picks</b></summary>

- **Per-show overrides**: per-IMDB quality, 4K and HEVC preferences.
- **Audio language preference**: boosts releases matching your language(s).
- **Auto-upgrade**: replaces 720p with cached 1080p or 2160p when available.
- **Season-pack consolidation**: swaps *N* per-episode torrents for one cached pack.
- **Trending pre-cache**: TMDB top-N auto-adds if already cached.
- **Trailer detection**: never accidentally plays the sample MP4.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🛡 Robustness</b></summary>

- SQLite **WAL mode** plus integrity check on startup, weekly `VACUUM`.
- **Per-IMDB mutex** prevents double-processing.
- **Failed-hash blacklist** after *N* retries.
- **Smart retry backoff** (60m / 6h / 24h).
- **Self-healing** strm probe and cleanup task.

- **Daily DB backup**, 14 retained.
- **Recovery wizard**: one-button repair pipeline.
- **Library import**: rebuild DB from `.strm` files after disaster.
- **Docker healthcheck** wired to `/health` so Synology auto-restarts on issues.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🖥 UX</b></summary>

- **Web-based setup wizard** on first launch (no `.env` editing required).
- Polished dashboard at `/ui`: 11 tabs, sortable tables, TMDB posters, dark/light theme.
- **Manual search & pick**: see every Zilean/Torrentio candidate, pick exactly which to add.
- **Runtime settings**: toggle Catbox mode, quality filters, etc. without restart.
- **Live stats**: quality distribution, source win-rate, latency, retry queue, library orphans.
- **Service health** dots in topbar.
- **Discord + Telegram** notifications on success, failure, disk, deadman.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Prerequisites
- Docker + Docker Compose
- A [TorBox](https://torbox.app) account (Essential plan or higher recommended)
- [Jellyseerr](https://jellyseerr.dev) / [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev) running
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) running

That's it. Out of the box Mycelium uses [Torrentio](https://torrentio.strem.fun) for scraping, which is a public service with no self-hosting required.

**Optional add-ons** (you don't need any of these to get started):
- [Zilean](https://github.com/iPromKnight/zilean): self-hosted local hash index, tried before Torrentio for faster and private search.
- [RealDebrid](https://real-debrid.com): alternative debrid as fallback when TorBox doesn't have a release cached.
- [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/consumers) API key: auto subtitle download.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corveck79/myce.git
cd myce
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **`http://<your-nas>:8088/ui`** and the setup wizard walks you through:

1. TorBox API key (the one required thing).
2. Jellyfin URL and API key.
3. Seerr URL and API key, plus TMDB token for posters.
4. Quality and audio language preferences.
5. Optional Catbox lazy mode.
6. Optional Discord/Telegram notifications.

Each connection step has a **Test** button so you find typos before you save. All values land in the runtime settings DB; you can re-run the wizard or edit individual settings via the Settings tab anytime.

Then in Seerr: **Settings → Notifications → Webhook** → `http://<your-nas>:8088/webhook`.

Prefer the old-school `.env` workflow? Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill it in, click **Skip wizard** on first visit.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Most settings are **hot-reloadable** via the Settings UI tab. Only scheduler intervals require a container restart.

The full reference lives in [`.env.example`](.env.example). Key knobs:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TORBOX_API_KEY` | *(set via wizard)* | From [torbox.app](https://torbox.app) → Settings → API |
| `CATBOX_MODE` | `false` | Lazy materialization (recommended once stable) |
| `CATBOX_HOST` | `http://10.0.0.10:8088` | Externally reachable URL for proxy strm URLs |
| `CATBOX_IDLE_MINUTES` | `60` | Idle time before a torrent is released from TorBox |
| `QUALITY_PREFERENCE` | `1080p,2160p,720p` | Comma-separated preference order |
| `ALLOW_4K` | `true` | Allow 2160p releases |
| `EXCLUDE_REMUX` | `true` | Skip BluRay remux unless no alternatives |
| `EXCLUDE_CAM` | `true` | Skip CAM/TS/screener |
| `PREFER_WEBDL` | `true` | Prefer WEB-DL sources |
| `PREFER_HEVC` | `true` | Prefer HEVC encodes |
| `MIN_SEEDERS` | `3` | Minimum seeder count |
| `AUDIO_LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE` | *(empty)* | e.g. `nl,en` |
| `AUTO_UPGRADE_ENABLED` | `true` | Periodic upgrade scan |
| `SEASON_PACK_CONSOLIDATION_ENABLED` | `true` | Replace per-episode torrents with packs |
| `TRENDING_PRECACHE_COUNT` | `0` | Top-N TMDB trending to auto-add (cached only) |
| `WEBDAV_ENABLED` | `false` | Serve library as virtual .mkv files (Plex compat) |
| `MULTI_DEBRID_ENABLED` | `false` | RealDebrid fallback when TorBox misses |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | *(empty)* | Optional notification target |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | *(empty)* | Optional notification target |
| `OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Optional subtitle download |

---

## 📡 Observability

The container exposes three endpoints:

| Endpoint | Used for |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | DB-aware liveness, wired to the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`. Returns **503** if SQLite is unreachable. |
| `GET /healthz` | Deep readiness, returns **503** if DB unreachable or both scrapers down. Useful for dashboards. |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus exposition. ~20 metrics covering throughput, latency, library size, retry depth, TorBox usage, Catbox state, service health. Scrape interval `30s` works well. |

In **Synology Container Manager** the healthcheck is picked up automatically; a red badge means the container will be auto-restarted within about 3 minutes.

### Grafana dashboard

A ready-made dashboard lives at [`assets/grafana-dashboard.json`](assets/grafana-dashboard.json). It includes:

- 24-hour KPIs (request count, success rate, p95 latency, last-success age, TorBox usage)
- Request rate stack (success vs failed)
- Latency p50 / p95 / p99 lines
- Source win-rate donut (Zilean vs Torrentio)
- Quality distribution bargauge
- Service-health stat tiles
- Library size trend (movies / series)
- Catbox virtual vs materialised gauge
- Retry queue, blacklist and wanted-episodes ops row
- Catbox stream-resolution rate (ok / rematerialized / failed)

To import: **Dashboards → New → Import → Upload JSON file**, then pick your Prometheus datasource.

## 🎬 Plex compatibility (opt-in)

Mycelium can serve the library as virtual `.mkv` files via WebDAV. Mount the share at the DSM host and any media server (Plex, Emby, Kodi, Infuse) can scan it like a normal filesystem. The container itself does **not** require FUSE; the mount is done at host level using DSM's built-in `davfs2`.

**Enable it:**

```env
WEBDAV_ENABLED=true
```

(or toggle in the Settings tab once the container is up).

**Mount on the DSM host** (one-time):

```bash
# SSH into DSM, then:
sudo synopkg install davfs2          # via Package Center if not present
sudo mkdir -p /volume1/mycelium-library
sudo mount -t davfs \
    http://localhost:8088/dav \
    /volume1/mycelium-library
```

Add to `/etc/fstab` for auto-remount after reboot:

```
http://localhost:8088/dav  /volume1/mycelium-library  davfs  rw,user,_netdev  0  0
```

**Wire into Plex** in your other compose file:

```yaml
services:
  plex:
    image: plexinc/pms-docker
    volumes:
      - /volume1/mycelium-library:/data/library:ro
    # ... rest of plex config
```

Plex sees `/data/library/movies/Inception (2010)/Inception (2010).mkv` as a regular file. On read, Mycelium streams bytes from TorBox CDN with HTTP Range support so seeking and transcoding work transparently.

**Supported methods:** `OPTIONS`, `PROPFIND`, `HEAD`, `GET` (read-only).

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from TMC?</b></summary>

TMC (TorBox Media Center) is the obvious off-the-shelf option, but in my experience it deletes the entire `.strm` library on restart, crashes during metadata builds, and lacks any UI for figuring out what went wrong. Mycelium rebuilds the same idea with WAL-mode SQLite, per-IMDB mutexes, idempotency on webhooks, daily backups, a recovery wizard, and a dashboard so you can actually see what's happening.

If TMC works for you, great. If it doesn't, this exists.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from elfhosted's CatBox?</b></summary>

CatBox is the gold standard for the lazy-materialise pattern, but it's a managed hosting service: you pay elfhosted, they run it for you. Mycelium runs on your own NAS or VPS, with your own TorBox account, no third-party infrastructure. The Catbox-style mode in Mycelium is directly inspired by their work and credited as such.

Mycelium also targets Seerr webhooks rather than the Radarr/Sonarr ecosystem CatBox supports.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why not just use rclone + Plex?</b></summary>

Rclone requires FUSE inside the container, which on Synology DSM means giving the container `SYS_ADMIN` and a `/dev/fuse` device. That's fragile and breaks across DSM updates. Mycelium writes `.strm` files Jellyfin reads as URLs, no kernel-level magic needed.

Plex doesn't support `.strm` natively, but the optional WebDAV server (see above) closes that gap without rclone.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What's the difference between fixed strm and Catbox mode?</b></summary>

In **fixed strm** mode, each `.strm` contains a direct TorBox CDN URL. Simple, works even when this service is down, but URLs may rot after about 30 days as TorBox cycles its cache. The cleanup task repairs them on a 24h schedule.

In **Catbox mode**, each `.strm` contains a proxy URL pointing at this service. On playback we re-add the torrent (if released), fetch a fresh URL, and 307-redirect. No URL rot, library size effectively unlimited, but playback requires Mycelium to be up.

Most people should enable Catbox once they trust the setup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this work with Radarr / Sonarr?</b></summary>

Not directly. Mycelium consumes Seerr webhooks, not the qBittorrent API. If you want Radarr / Sonarr compatibility, [elfhosted's CatBox](https://docs.elfhosted.com/app/catbox/) is the production-grade option.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I made a bad request and now it's stuck retrying. How do I stop it?</b></summary>

Settings tab → **Blacklist** → add the offending hash, or just `DELETE` the entry from `retry_queue` table. The blacklist auto-fills after `BLACKLIST_FAIL_THRESHOLD` consecutive failures (default 3).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will this run on a Raspberry Pi?</b></summary>

Probably. Memory footprint is about 150 MB. Disk requirements are minimal (`.strm` files are roughly 200 bytes each). The Dockerfile is `python:3.12-slim` which has ARM64 and ARMv7 variants. Untested by me.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My library disappeared after a restart!</b></summary>

Most likely the `./data` volume isn't being mounted. Check `docker compose config` and verify `./data:/data`. The DB lives at `/data/requests.db` and `.strm` files at `/data/media`. With the volume preserved, nothing should be lost.

If the DB itself is corrupted: Overview → **🚑 Recovery wizard** rebuilds the DB by scanning the `.strm` map on disk.
</details>
